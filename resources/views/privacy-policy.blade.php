                        throughout its life cycle, from collection to use and disclosure, storage, accessibility
                        and disposal.</p>

                    <p>We are committed to ensuring that personal information we collect about you is held
                        securely. We will take reasonable steps to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="first">ensure that any personal information we collect, use and disclose is
                            accurate, complete and up to date (our main method for ensuring that your personal
                            information is accurate, complete and up to date is by giving you the ability to
                            update your user account details online and you can help us to keep the personal
                            information we hold about you accurate, complete and up to date by updating your
                            user account details online whenever necessary);</li>
                        <li>protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised
                            access, modification or disclosure: and</li>
                        <li class="last">destroy or permanently de-identify personal information as required by
                            the Privacy Law, subject to other legal record retention requirements.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The information we hold about you in your user account for our website can be reviewed
                        and modified by you clicking on the &quot;My Profile&quot; link and selecting the
                        &quot;Edit My Details&quot; option. The accuracy of the user account data is solely your
                        responsibility and not ours.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>While we endeavour to implement high levels of security to protect users of our website,
                        you should note that there is an inherent risk associated with the use of an insecure
                        network such as the world wide web. We cannot exclude the possibility that a user&#39;s
                        personal information (including emails) may be viewed, intercepted or modified by a
                        third party.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>4.&nbsp;Access to and Correction of your Personal Information</h3>

                    <p>You have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you, subject to
                        any exceptions in the Privacy Law. A charge may apply for providing such access. You may
                        also request that personal information which we hold about you be corrected. Please
                        contact us in writing at the following address if you would like to access personal
                        information that we hold about you:</p>

                    </p>

                    <p>If access to or correction of your personal information is refused, we will provide you
                        with written reasons for the refusal.</p>

                    <h3>5.&nbsp;Government Identifiers</h3>

                    <p>Except to the extent permitted by the Privacy Law, we will not use your Commonwealth
                        identifiers (such as a Medicare number) as our own identifier for you nor will we
                        disclose such identifiers to anyone else.</p>

                    <h3>6.&nbsp;Anonymity</h3>

                    <p>If it is lawful and practicable to do so, we will provide you with the option of not
                        identifying yourself when entering into transactions with us. For example, you may
                        browse and download public articles from our website without providing us with personal
                        information.</p>

                    <h3>7.&nbsp;Transborder Data Flows</h3>

                    <p>If we transfer your personal information outside Tanzanian, we will comply with those
                        requirements of the Privacy Law which relate to transborder data flows.<br />
